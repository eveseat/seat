# Feature Request
*This template contains an example feature request. Please replace all text except for the checklist and the section headers (they start with \#). Thank you for your contribution to improve SeAT.*

*In this space, please provide a short description of your feature request.
This should help us to understood what you'd like to be able to do. E.g.:*

It would be great having a corporation Dashboard for Directors/CEOs as home-screen containing following information:

- Compliance stats (number of members with valid tokens and token changes),
- Member changes (join/leave)
- Role/title changes
- Ship location change by condition (ex: if a titan or super has left Delve)
- Player interaction by condition (ex: wallet transaction, contract, trade, evemail if set red or on a watch list)
- Structure status (only show structures in low power, less than 24hrs fuel, or reinforced)

## Business Case

*Please provide an estimate on how this feature helps you in your life as SeAT user.*

As CEO/Director I have the most important KPI's on hand and save up to 20 minutes prior to logging in as I have the relevant information on hand.

## Mockup

*If available, please provide a screenshot, a drawing or a mockup how your feature request could look like after implementation.*

## Process

*Please explain how you'd be using the feature in a procedural way:*

After login, as CEO/Director i land on Corporation Dashboard as homepage instead of character dashboard. Alternatively extend the corporation sheet.

## Alternatives

*Some requests are more complex than others. If you have an idea about alternatives or less complex ideas to implement your feature request, use this space to elaborate your ideas.*

If the corporation dashboard could not be implemented as landing page after login, extend the corporation sheet accordingly. 

## Acceptance Criterias

*Only fill this sections if you feel comfortable doing so*

*Please use gherkin structure. E.g:*

*GIVEN* a working SeAT instance with corporations and characters registered.  
*WHEN* a CEO or director of an already registered corporation log in to SeAT  
*THEN* show the corporation dashboard as landing page

*GIVEN* a ceo or director log in into seat  
*WHEN* the corporation dashboard is loaded  
*THEN* show latest member join/leaves (name, date and action).

*GIVEN* a ceo or director log in into seat  
*WHEN* the corporation dashboard is loaded  
*THEN* show structures running out of fuel in the next 72hrs.
