</h2>

SeAT is a simple, [EVE Online](https://www.eveonline.com/) Corporation and API management tool, built using [Laravel](https://laravel.com/). SeAT allows you to keep an eye on all things related to your corporation; from wallets, to mail, to assets for both characters and corporations. Notifications can be sent based on starbase fuel levels and a fully featured role based access control system allows you to tightly control who has access to what. This repository contains the main SeAT Repository. It can be seen as the 'glue' for all of the SeAT core packages.

# SeAT 3 / ESI Update
SeAT plans to fully support ESI. Please refer to [this](https://github.com/eveseat/seat/issues/262) issue for progress tracking and other status updates. For the latest news, please join us on [Slack](https://eve-seat.slack.com/).

For a development instance of SeAT 3, check out the docker-compose configuration [here](https://github.com/eveseat/scripts/tree/master/docker-compose-dev).
